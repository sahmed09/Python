"""Time taken by QuickSort in general can be written as following: T(n) = T(k) + T(n-k-1) + theta(n)
The first two terms are for two recursive calls, the last term is for the partition process. 
k is the number of elements which are smaller than pivot.
Worst Case: The worst case occurs when the partition process always picks greatest or smallest element as pivot.
    Following is recurrence for worst case. T(n) = T(0) + T(n-1) + theta(n)
    The solution of above recurrence is theta(n^2).
Best Case: The best case occurs when the partition process always picks the middle element as pivot.
    Following is recurrence for best case T(n) = 2T(n/2) + theta(n)
    The solution of above recurrence is theta(nLogn)
Average Case: To do average case analysis, we need to consider all possible permutation of array and calculate time 
    taken by every permutation which doesnâ€™t look easy.
     Following is recurrence for this case. T(n) = T(n/9) + T(9n/10) + theta(n)
     Solution of above recurrence is also O(nLogn)"""
