# Normal Approach:
"""STEP 1: Create a list, letters, of size 26. Initialize each element to 0.
STEP 2: Traverse through the input string S. If a character in the string is 'a', then increment letter[0] 
    by 1. If 'b' is found, then increment letter[1] by 1 and so on.
STEP 3: Now run a loop three times. Inside the loop, store the maximum value of letters in the variable
    max_letter.
STEP 4:. In the scope of the previous loop, run another loop and find the index of the first occurrence 
    of max_letter. Now, print the appropriate letter associated with that index and the max_letter."""
